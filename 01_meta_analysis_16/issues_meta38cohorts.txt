#COHORT issues
1. MARS cohort shows low effect sizes, no positive control in 4f and low Mstat. Imputation issues. Submitters asked to withdrawn this cohort.
2. Factor V Leiden Study shows deflated lambda in 4f and inflated lambda in 16b. This cohort has issues with family relatedness. We are still running tests.
3. EPICOR has coded INDELS incorrectly. We need to recode Y/Z to I/D otherwise 600000 variants will be removed. If it can't be fixed we need to remove these INDELS before running meta analysis.
4. DunedIN has submitted the same samples twice (at age 26 and at age 38). We only use age 26.


#Variant filtering
1. Flipped SNPs. 
There is a list here: /panfs/panasas01/shared-godmc/godmc_phase2_analysis/data/ref/flipped_snps.txt
Every cohort has uploaded a SNP list on the sftp that are flipped. These SNPs needs to be flipped back.
2. There are SNPs with sequence coding which are not harmonized across cohorts. These are not indels as A1 and A2 have the same lenght. However, cohorts have coded these inconsistently causing a high I2 in the meta analysis
This is the list: /panfs/panasas01/shared-godmc/INDELs/indels_equal_seq_length.txt 

#Probe filtering
1. We retain probes from Zhou et al.
~/repo/godmc_phase1_analysis/07.snp_cpg_selection/data/retain_from_zhou.txt
2. We exclude probes from TwinsUK
