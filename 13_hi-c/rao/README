Data Acquisition and cleaning
Trans inter-chromosomal interactions was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525 (Rao et.al 2014 ) (~35 Gb)
Data was stored in relevant independent inter-chromosomal directories and contained the raw contact data, and KR norm vectors.
Data included the inter-chromosomal interactions for the GM12878 sample at the 1 kb interaction region resolution and quality threshold E30 and was normalised using the KR norm vectors as described in Rao et al. 
Data was required to be normalised prior to overlap analysis. Normalisation was achieved by taking the raw observed contact matrix (containing I (bait), j (other end), M_ij (value of counts)) and dividing the entry (row observation) by corresponding norm factors for I and j line. For example:
# e.g RAWobserved file:
	# 40000 41000 59
	# divide 59 by ((40000/1000)+1=41) 41st line and ((41000/1000)+1=42) 42nd line
	# therefore = 59/(line_i*line_j)
	# KR vectors i=first chr (left) and j=second chr (right)
	# All data 1kb matrix resolution and > MAPQE30
